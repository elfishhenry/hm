Anyone using a developer application that I developed (elfishhenry) or one associated with me or my team is bound by the privacy policy and terms written here.


1: This bot should be used with Discord's tos, guidelines and other terms, kept in mind, and followed.

2: I expect that if any security issues come upon my bot, should be reported to me (elfishhenry) so that I can fix any issues as soon as possible if the need arises that it is a big issue of data privacy, I will remove my bots functionality temporarily, to fix issues which will be at my digression.

3: De-facto laws, this is more or less unofficial, but use common sense when it comes to the do-s or don't-s or the usage of this bot.
